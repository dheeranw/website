    <p>Welcome to <em>Hidden Subgroups and Quantum Computation</em>. This summer we will study the<hl>
        <li>rudiments of group (representation) theory and linear algebra.</li>
        <li>axiomatic foundations of quantum theory.</li>
        <li>circuit model via unitary gates on \(\mathcal{H} \simeq (\mathbb{C}^2)^{\otimes n}\). </li>
        <li>quantum Fourier transform \(F_n\) on \(\mathbb{Z}/n\).</li>
        <li>abelian hidden subgroup problem.</li>
        <li>results toward the nonabelian hidden subgroup problem.</li>
        We will take a rigorous approach to the relevant mathematics, but our focus will be on developing quantum computing intuition from the algebra.<p>
Beautiful mathematics can be found in every corner of quantum research. <em>But, it is hard.</em> My hope is that by the end of these lectures, you will be well-equipped to break into the literature, whether textbooks or papers. In particular, we will close out our discussion by working through some research papers ourselves.
        </p> <p>It is worth noting that while my quantum computation background has mostly been via mathematics, people from physics, computer science, and electrical engineering are working on these problems. I will do my best to incorporate as many of these perspectives as I can into lecture. If you are partial to some flavor of the subjects above, I will point you towards references. You will also have the freedom to choose hidden subgroup problem papers to read, and occasionally present, based on your interests.</p>

<h3>Textbook</h3>
<p><em>No textbook is required.</em> I will prepare weekly slides in \(\LaTeX\) and occasionally lecture at the board. There is a wealth of literature on the underlying mathematics and the hidden subgroup problem. Some of my favorites include <hl>
  <li><em>The Hidden Subgroup Problem: Review and Open Problems</em> by Chris Lomont. This survey is thorough and has a great list of references for the subject. The appendices are also nice.</li>
  <li><em>The Hidden Subgroup Problem</em> by Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Wang. The technical foundations of the hidden subgroup problem are detailed out in this wonderful Master's project. Further, it dips into research-level results and novel contributions, which would be a good first taste before jumping into the literature.</li>
    <li><em>Quantum Computation and Quantum Information</em> "Mike and Ike" by Michael Nielsen and Isaac Chuang. This is a very standard text which does its best to balance all aspects of introductory quantum information. I think it does a good job.</li>
    <li><em>Linear Algebra</em> by Stephen Friedberg, Arnold Insel, and Lawrence Spence. This is my favorite of the "quintessential" linear algebra texts. The treatment is rigorous, while not trying too hard to be an abstract algebra book.</li>
    <li><em>Abstract Algebra</em> by David Dummit and Richard Foote. If you want to learn algebra, Dummit and Foote will carry you through the fundamentals, and further.</li>

<h3>Assignments and Deliverables</h3>
<p>This minicourse will have regular problem sets. Notably, I will include a handful exercises to be done as homework between lectures These will be pretty brief and should be easy after sitting through lecture. If not, I am happy to work through them with you!</p><p> You will also prepare a review paper detailing interesting results from lecture and your own reading.

  <h3>Catalog Description</h3> 
  <p>The idea for this minicourse on the hidden subgroup problem is due to IMSA alumnus Doug Strain at <em>Google Research</em>. Below is his original description for the course.</p>
  <p>Much of quantum computing's advantage comes from the foundations of the hidden subgroup problem. Textbook algorithms such as Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon's problem, and Shor's algorithm can all be phrased using the language of abstract algebra as the hidden subgroup problem. Students will learn basic concepts in group theory and how quantum computing can be thought of in terms of groups. Students will learn Shor's algorithm in terms of the abelian HSP and will explore progress in exploring the HSP for nonabelian groups.
